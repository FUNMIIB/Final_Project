# Final_Project
**Presentation**

- Presentation Topic: Data Scientist Salary

- Reason Why They Selected Their Topic: The machine learning model selected was a supervised Logistic Regression model. This model was selected because we are looking to see if we are able to predict having 5 or more skillsets equals a higher salary.

- Description of Their Source of Data: The compiled data was found on kaggle but the dataset was scraped from the Glassdoor website using Selenium scrapper by Nikhil Bhathi a nuclear scientist at Nova Scotia. After scrapping the raw data, the duplicated rows was removed which reduced the records from 1000 to 742. The dataset has 42 columns including the Job title, Salary Estimate, Job Description, Rating, Company, Location, Company , Headquarters, etc 

- Questions They Hope to Answer With The Data: If having 5 or more skillsets equals a higher salary.

**Machine Learning Model**
We will implement the supervised Logistic Regression machine learning model with the data scientist salary dataset. This model will allow us to create training and test groups from the dataset to predict if having 5 or more skillsets equals higher salary. This analysis will also answer the following questions: 
- How are we training the model? 
- What is the model's accuracy score? 
- How does the model work?

**Database**
Jupyter notebook was used to create the database. The csv was read into python using pandas
A provisional database that mimics the final database structure is presented

Team members present a provisional
database that stands in for the final
database and accomplishes the
following:
✓ Sample data that mimics the
expected final database structure or
schema ✓ Draft machine learning module is
connected to the provisional database
**Technologies used**
We created a repository named Final Project Github
Machine learning
Building the database using Jupyter notebook









In the final project there are four roles responsible for different portion of the project. The JHoward branch is the square role and is responsible for creating a simple machine learning model. The machine learning model selected was a supervised Logistic Regression model. This model was selected because we are looking to see we are able to predict having 5 or more skillset equals a higher salary. The purpose of this analysis is to provide insight to data analyst students that would help direct their career path or educational journey.
